## üöÄ Overview

This **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** demonstrates an end-to-end **Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)** lifecycle by deploying a trained sentiment analysis model via a robust **Flask API** and a simple web interface. 
The primary goal of this project is to showcase production readiness, robust dependency management, and preparedness for containerization and cloud deployment.

### Problem Solved
This tool quickly analyzes and classifies text input (e.g., customer reviews, feedback) as either positive or negative, providing an instant sentiment score and showcasing a deployed, working ML pipeline.

---

## ‚ú® Features

* **End-to-End MLOps Pipeline:** Demonstrates training, serialization, and deployment of an ML model.
* **Production-Ready API:** Uses **Flask** served by **Gunicorn** for a performant and scalable API.
* **Robust Preprocessing:** Includes stop word removal and Porter stemming.
* **High Accuracy:** Utilizes a **Logistic Regression** classifier achieving approximately **87% accuracy** on the IMDB reviews dataset.
* **Reproducibility:** Strict dependency management via `requirements.txt` and environment isolation using Python `venv`.
* **Live Deployment:** The application is live and accessible via a modern PaaS.

## üì¶ Installation & Local Setup

Follow these steps to get a local copy up and running on your machine.

### Prerequisites

* **Python** version 3.8 or higher.
* **Git** for cloning the repository.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Aashutosh-357/Project-Sentiment-Analysis
    cd Project-Sentiment-Analysis
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate Virtual Environment**
    ```bash
    # Create the venv
    python3 -m venv venv

    # Activate the venv (Linux/macOS)
    source venv/bin/activate
    
    # Activate the venv (Windows)
    # .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**
    Install all required libraries, ensuring the correct `scikit-learn` version for model compatibility.
    ```bash
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Run the Application**
    Start the Flask server using the Python executable inside your active virtual environment.
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    The application will be accessible locally at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## üéØ Usage

Once the server is running, the main interface is the web page at `/` where you can input text.

### Example Interaction

You can use a tool like **`curl`** or **Postman** to hit the prediction API endpoint (`/predict`).

```bash
# Example API call to the local server
curl -X POST [http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict](http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict) \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"text": "This movie was absolutely phenomenal and the acting was superb!"}'
````

**Expected JSON Response:**

```json
{
  "text": "This movie was absolutely phenomenal and the acting was superb!",
  "prediction": "Positive",
  "probability": 0.957
}
```
